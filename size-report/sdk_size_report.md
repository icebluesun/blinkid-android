## BlinkID SDK size report

This is SDK size report for all supported ABIs. Sizes are calculated by using Android official [**apkanalyzer**](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/apkanalyzer) command line tool.

**NOTE**: Presented APK sizes are sums of `base APK size` + `size of our SDK`. Roughly, `base APK size` is about `1MB`, which means that APK size increase caused by our SDK in your application will be less than presented for approximately `1MB`.

| ABI | APK file size | APK download size |

| armeabi-v7a | 8.4MB | 6.1MB |
| arm64-v8a | 9.4MB | 6.3MB |
